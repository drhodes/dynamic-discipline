      Combinational devices use the static discipline to mitigate
      noise on their terminals.  Sequential devices use the <b>dynamic
        discipline</b>
      
      
      focuses on time. enters the circuit by
      using lenciency during ... .timing to the mix and can elude even
      the most careful thinkers. So beware!
    </p>
    
    <p> The plan is to use feedback with a lenient mux to build a
    reliable D-latch. </p>

    Here are the steps outlined in the sequential logic section of the
    computation structures <a href="https://computationstructures.org/notes/sequential_logic/notes.html">notes</a>
    </p>
    
    <h2> To reliably latch 1 </h2>
    <h3> Apply 1 to D, holding G=1 </h3>
    <h3> After another TPD, Q’ & D both valid for TPD; will hold Q=1 independently of G </h3>
    <h3> Set G=0, while Q’ & D hold Q=D </h3>
    <h3> After TPD, 1 appears at Q=Q’ </h3>
    <h3> After another TPD, G=0 and Q’ are sufficient to hold Q=1 independently of D </h3>
    
    - To reliably latch 0:
    • Apply 0 to D, holding G=1
    • After another TPD, Q’ & D both valid for TPD; will hold Q=0 independently of G
    • Set G=0, while Q’ & D hold Q=D
    • After TPD, 0 appears at Q=Q’
    • After another TPD, G=0 and Q’ are sufficient to hold Q=0 independently of D
